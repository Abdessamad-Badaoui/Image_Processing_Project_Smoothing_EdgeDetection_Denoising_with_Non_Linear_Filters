# Image_Processing_Project_Smoothing_EdgeDetection_Denoising_with_Non_Linear_Filters

This C-based image processing project focuses on implementing essential techniques for image enhancement and noise reduction using non-linear filters. It covers three fundamental aspects: smoothing, edge detection, and denoising. Smoothing algorithms like mean, median, and Gaussian filters are employed to reduce noise and produce a smoother appearance. Edge detection methods such as the Sobel operator and Canny edge detector are utilized to highlight object boundaries. Non-linear denoising filters, including the median filter and bilateral filter, are applied to effectively reduce noise while preserving image details.
